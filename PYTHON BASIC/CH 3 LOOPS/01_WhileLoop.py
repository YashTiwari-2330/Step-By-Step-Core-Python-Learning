# LOOPS :-
        # LOOPS ARE USE TO REPEAT A SET OF STATEMENT IN OUR PROGRAM , LOOPS MAKE IT EASY TO PROGRAMMER TO CREATE A LONG CONDITION AT SOME LINES OF CODE USING LOOPS
        # TYPE OF LOOPS :
                        # 1 - WHILE LOOP , AND 2 - FOR LOOP
 # 1 - WHILE LOOP:-
                # IN WHILE LOOP THE CONDITION IS CHECKED FIRST IF IT EVALUATED TO TRUE AFTER BODY OF LOOP EXECUTED
                # WHILE LOOP CONTINUES PROCESS WHENEVER CONDITION IS NOT BECOME FALSE
                # if you perform some operation using loop and define some variable it's called "ITERATOR" and perform work condition called "ITERATION".
                # WHEN USING LOOPS IN LIST AND TUPLES AND ASSESS THE NUMBERS OF LIST AND TUPLE IT'S CALLED "TRAVERSE :- TO TRAVEL ONE BY ONE ALL THE ELEMENTS"
